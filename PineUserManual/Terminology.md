# Terminology

### realtime
While there are recommendations to use a hyphen when it's used as an adjective, and distinct words when used as a noun, 
we will keep things simple and adopt the more modern and increasingly popular spelling in one word for all uses:

- *A realtime bar*, *realtime calculations*
- *A script running in real time*

### timeframe
We use "timeframe" to name what has historically be called "interval", "resolution" or "time frame".
