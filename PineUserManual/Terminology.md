# Terminology

### argument & parameter
We use "parameter" to designate the name of the values a function accepts, as defined in the function's signature. 
When referring to values passed to a function when calling it, we use "argument":
- *Defining the type of function parameters in library function declarations is mandatory."
- *A "simple int" argument is required for the length parameter in ``sma()``.*

### realtime
While there are recommendations to use a hyphen when it's used as an adjective, and distinct words when used as a noun, 
we will keep things simple and adopt the more modern and increasingly popular spelling in one word for all uses:
- *A realtime bar*, *realtime calculations*
- *A script running in real time*

### timeframe
We use "timeframe" to name what has historically be called "interval", "resolution" or "time frame".
