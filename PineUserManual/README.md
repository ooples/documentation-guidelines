## Terminology

**realtime**  
While there are recommendations to use a hyphen when it's used as an adjective, and distinct words when used as a noun, we will keep things simple and adopt the more modern and increasingly popular spelling in one word for all uses.

**timeframe**  
We use "timeframe" to name what has historically be called "interval", "resolution" or "time frame".
