# Terminology

### argument vs parameter
We use "parameter" to designate the name of the values a function accepts when referring to the function's signature, or to the function in general. 
When referring to values passed to a function when calling it, we use "argument":
- *Defining the type of function parameters in library function declarations is mandatory.*
- *A "simple int" argument is required for the length parameter in ``sma()``.*

### ID
When referring to pointers to plots, hlines, drawings or arrays, we use "ID" for singular and "IDs" for plural:
- *Both IDs used to identify the lines to be filled in ``fill()`` must be either plot IDs or hline IDs.*
- *Drawing IDs are time series; array IDs are not.*

### "realtime" vs "real time"
We use "realtime" when it is an adjective and "real time" when "time" is used as a noun:
- *A realtime bar*
- *Realtime calculations*
- *A script running in real time*

### "timeframe"
We use "timeframe" to name what has historically be called "interval", "resolution" or "time frame".
